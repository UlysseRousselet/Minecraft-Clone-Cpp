# Minecraft-Clone-Cpp
Minecraft clone in 3D created with opengl in c++

You can move around the world, placing and removing blocks.
The world is infinite and is generated with the perlin noise technique.
Chunks are 10 blocks long, 10 blocks wide, and 20 blocks high.
I would like to implement a seed system and online multiplayer later.

Make sure to have mingw64 or any installation of C, C++ installed on your pc or it will not work.
